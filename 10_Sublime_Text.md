1. Download and set up the sublime text.

2. After installing open sublime text and open a python file and build it with python so that it runs and output is printed.

3. Then perform package controller to install third party packages that add functionality to sublime text.

   tools->command palette->install package controller.

4. Difference between color scheme and theme is that color schemes change the color of your syntax and theme changes entire look and interface. Ckolor scheme pre-dawn and theme material is preferred.

   - To install color scheme then tools->command palette->package control Install package->Predawn
   - For theme, you need to replace it by Material Theme in above process.

5. We have default and user settings and we need to change user settings if we need to.
