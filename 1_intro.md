**checking python version in windows:-**

1. Go to the file location of python.exe runnable file and copy the folder location and add it into Path of environment variables as it is the third party which needs access through cmd.

2. Then directly type  **python --version** and press enter. You will find your python version if installed. 

   or

   Copy the file location and paste it in command prompt and then type **python --version**
