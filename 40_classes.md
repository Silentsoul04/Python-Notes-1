classes:- They allow us to logically group our data and functions in a way that's easy to reuse and also easy to build upon if needed.

method:- function that is associated with a class

class is basically a blueprint for creating instances and each unique employee that we create using our employee class in below example are the instance of that class.

Instances have different memory allocated for them.

eg:- self.first=first is similar to manually assigning like emp_1.first='name'. We can change as self.fname instead of self.first also.
