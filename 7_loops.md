**Loops :**(aditya)

* <b>For</b> Loop :

```python3
nums=[1,2,3,4,5]

for i in nums :				# loops through the entire list
	body
	
for i in range(1,11,2):			# loops through 1-10 with a step of 2
	body
```

* <b>While</b> Loop :

```python3
while condition :
	body
```

* Jump statements : break, continue.

Break keyword will completely break out of a loop and the continue keyword move on to the next iteration of the loop.

**for loop:-**

1. Loop within a loop:-**

eg:- ![1547639419538](https://github.com/adityakuppa26/Python-Notes/blob/lalith_notes/images/1547639419538.png)

1. **Range:-**

   eg:- 

   ![1547639499156](https://github.com/adityakuppa26/Python-Notes/blob/lalith_notes/images/1547639499156.png)

   ![1547639549209](https://github.com/adityakuppa26/Python-Notes/blob/lalith_notes/images/1547639549209.png)

   **While loop:-**

1. eg:- ![1547639659980](https://github.com/adityakuppa26/Python-Notes/blob/lalith_notes/images/1547639659980.png)

   

2. Break and continue can also be used similarly as we did in for for loop.

3. use ctrl+c in case of infinte loops(while True:) to stop.

For and while

for i in range():


for i in 'abc':

'break' statement will exit the innermost loop

'continue' will skip the following statements and moves to the next iteration
